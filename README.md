# wordpress-betweentime
A wordpress plugin I create for a customer that needed to show different sliders between some hours.

Of course you can adapt the plugin to your needs. In a near future i will edit to to allow changes directly in wordpress.

Shortcode Example:
[betweentime a_start="13:00" a_end="16:30" b_start="20:30" b_end="23:30" codea="menu-es-1" codeb="menu-es-11" codec="slider-1-1"]
